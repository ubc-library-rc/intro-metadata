# Research Data Management (RDM) and Metadata

RDM refers to the storage, access, curation, and preservation of research data. Research data is typically stored in repositories, which require the depositor to create metadata to support any submitted datasets. Research data typically uses unique identifiers to organize the location of digital resources.

There are a number of common open source repository platforms, including Dataverse, CKAN, and DSpace. Each platform uses its own metadata schema. Further, each of these platforms can be adapted by an institution. Examples include:
* UBC has a Dataverse for licensed data called [Abacus](http://dvn.library.ubc.ca/dvn/)
* [Scholars Portal Dataverse](https://dataverse.scholarsportal.info) is based out of University of Toronto and contains data from a number of institutions (55 schools) across Canada (including UBC)
* The Government of Canada’s [Open Data](https://open.canada.ca/en/open-data) portal uses CKAN

Canada’s [Federated Research Data Repository (FRDR)](https://www.frdr-dfdr.ca) aggregates data from different repositories across Canada

Why is metadata important for research data? Metadata play a large role in the facilitation of FAIR Principles.

## Readme files: a typical starting point for metadata creation

In research, readme files are often a starting point for creating basic metadata. In order for the metadata to be effective for interpretation, there are best practices to keep in mind.

Best practices for readme files (illustrative; not comprehensive)
* Create one file for each logical grouping of data - could be a single data file, or a dataset with multiple files that are related
* Use a plain text file
* If you are creating multiple readme files, use consistent formatting
* Use date format YYYY-MM-DD or YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss
* Use keywords appropriate to your discipline - often controlled vocabularies or thesauri are available for discipline specific keywords
