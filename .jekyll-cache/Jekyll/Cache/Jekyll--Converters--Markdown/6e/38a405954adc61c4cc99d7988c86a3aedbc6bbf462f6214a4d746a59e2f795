<p>Active participation enlivens the session with other voices and perspectives. We encourage you to engage with instructors and with each other.</p>

<p>Microphones are muted by default to improve audio quality and recording is disabled to preserve participant privacy.</p>

<p>The Zoom toolbar provides several ways to be part of the conversation:</p>

<h2 id="participants-window">Participants window</h2>
<p>The <em>Participants</em> window lists everyone in the session. Click the icons at the bottom of the window to communicate with the instructors.</p>

<p><img src="content/zoom-figures/participants_window_menu.png" alt="Menu at bottom of participants window" /></p>

<p>Clicking an icon makes it appear next to your name in the participants list. Use this to <strong>answer yes/no</strong> questions or to <strong>raise your hand</strong> when instructors invite you to ask a question, comment, or share your screen.
<br /></p>
<h2 id="chat-window">Chat window</h2>
<p>Use the <em>Chat</em> window to comment or ask a question at any time. Instructors will do their best to respond, sometimes waiting for a break in the lesson to do so.</p>

<p>The <em>Chat</em> window is a good place to report problems with your audio connection. Instructors may also use it to share links to material mentioned in the session.
<br /></p>
<h2 id="share-your-screen">Share your screen</h2>
<p>In some cases instructors may invite you to share your screen. Raise your hand to indicate that youâ€™re ready to share. When called upon click <em>Share screen</em>, select a window to display, and click <em>Share</em>.
<br /></p>
<h2 id="contribute-to-the-whiteboard">Contribute to the Whiteboard</h2>
<p>The <em>Whiteboard</em> is a collaborative space that everyone can annotate with drawings and text. When the whiteboard is shared click <em>View options</em> and select <em>Annotate</em>.</p>

<p><img src="content/zoom-figures/open_annotate_toolbar.png" alt="Menu with Annotate option" /></p>

<p>This opens the annotation toolbar. Drawings and text you add to the screen will be visible to everyone in the session or breakout room.</p>
